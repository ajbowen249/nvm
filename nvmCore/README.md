# NVM Specification

_Note: This document exists as a scratchpad of ideas as the NVM is developed. It will likely be hard to follow until features are finalized. As such, anything in this document is very likely subject to change._

## Registers
The registers in the NVM are type-safe. That is, there are multiple registers for each primitive type (int, unsigned int, float, etc...). The mnemonic way of referring to a type is as follows:
```
[type code]-[register number]
For example:
ui32-1
f64-12
i8-5
```

Instructions that use registers take an entire byte to refer to them. The first bit flags wether a register is gereal-purpose, or a system register (stack pointer, etc.). The next three bits are the type, and the final four bytes are the register index. Type codes are as follows:
```
i8:   000
ui8:  001
i16:  010
ui16: 011
i32:  100
ui32: 101
f32:  110
f64:  111
```

The types of the registers define how they should be treated in mathematical operations. As such, there should be no legal assembly code with a mismatch of register types. For example,
```
ADD ui32-1 ui32-1 i8-2
```

should not be allowed.

## Flags

### Status Flags
- Negative (N): The result of the previous numeric operation was negative.
- Positive (P): The result of the previous numeric operation was positive.
- Zero     (Z): The result of the previous numeric operation was exactly zero.

## The Stack
There is a stack that grows from the bottom of memory. The stack pointer a system register, SP, of the unsigned type that matches the configured address space. Pushing to or popping from the stack will decrement or increment the stack pointer by the number of bytes required to store the type being pushed. It is also responsible for keeping track of the instruction pointer across subroutine calls.

|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| 00000110 | cc r s n f RR | xxxxxxxx        |
|          | jump code     | additional data |

Jumps the instruction pointer to a new address based on a set of conditions. The conditions are determined by the second byte, the jump code. The jump code has the format:
- 0-1: Condition Code. These are:
       00: unconditional (always jump)
       01: jump if negative
       10: jump if zero
       11: jump if positive

- 2: Relative Flag. Jump will be relative to the current address if set.
- 3: Source Flag. If set, the source will be a register. If clear, the source will be a literal value. If using a register source, the next byte is the type and number of the desired register. Attempting to use a register of a floating-point type will cause an error. Otherwise, the next n bytes are a literal address_t.
- 4: Negative Flag. If the Source Flag is clear and this is set, the literal value will be subtracted from the current address, rather than added. This is ignored if the Source Flag is set or the instruction is not relative.
- 5: Function (subroutine) Flag. If set, the current instruction pointer address will be pushed to the stack before jumping.
- 6-7: Reserved bits for future use.

Attempts to jump beyond the addressible memory range will result in an error.

### Return
**Mnemonic**: RET

**Length**: 1

**Affects Flags**: None

| 0        |
|----------|
| 00000111 |

Pops an address_t from the stack and jumps the instruction pointer there. Executing this with an empty stack or with an address outside the addressible memory range will cause an error.

### Increment

|----------|---------------------------------|
| 00001000 | tttt rrrr                       |
|          | type and number of the register |

|----------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 00001010 | tttt rrrr                                   | s a RR rrrr		   | xxxxxxxx		 |
|          | type and number of destination the register | address source code | additional data |

Reads a value from memory into the register specified by the seond byte. Attempting to read from an address higher than max memory minus the size of the register type will produce an error. The third byte specifies from where the read adrress will come. It has the format:
- 0: Source flag. If set, the source will be a register. If clear, the source will be an address_t specified by the remaining bytes.
- 1: Add flag. If the source flag and this flag are both set, two registers will be added together to form the read address.
- 2-3: Reserved for future use.
- 4-7: Type of the register(s) to be used if the source flag is set.

When sourcing the read address from a register, an error will be thrown when attempting to use a floating-point type or for negative values.

### Write
**Mnemonic**: WR

**Length**: variable

**Affects Flags**: None

|----------|------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 00001011 | tttt rrrr                                | s a RR rrrr		   | xxxxxxxx		 |
|          | type and number of the register to store | address source code | additional data |

Writes a value to memory from the register specified by the seond byte. Attempting to write to an address higher than max memory minus the size of the register type will produce an error. The third byte specifies from where the write adrress will come. It has the format:
- 0: Source flag. If set, the source will be a register. If clear, the source will be an address_t specified by the remaining bytes.
- 1: Add flag. If the source flag and this flag are both set, two registers will be added together to form the write address.
- 2-3: Reserved for future use.
- 4-7: Type of the register(s) to be used if the source flag is set.

When sourcing the write address from a register, an error will be thrown when attempting to use a floating-point type or for negative values.

**Mnemonic**: PUSH

**Length**: 2
